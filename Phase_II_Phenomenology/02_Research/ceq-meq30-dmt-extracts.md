# Psychedelic Phenomenology — MEQ30 - CEQ - DMT entity-encounter extracts

## MEQ-30 (Revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire) — checklist (paste into Obsidian; each item is 0–5)

> Instructions: “Looking back on the entirety of your session, please rate the degree to which at any time during that session you experienced the following phenomena.” (scale 0–5)

- [ ] 1. Freedom from the limitations of your personal self and feeling a unity or bond with what was felt to be greater than your personal self.
- [ ] 2. Experience of pure being and pure awareness (beyond the world of sense impressions).
- [ ] 3. Experience of oneness in relation to an “inner world” within.
- [ ] 4. Experience of the fusion of your personal self into a larger whole.
- [ ] 5. Experience of unity with ultimate reality.
- [ ] 6. Feeling that you experienced eternity or infinity.
- [ ] 7. Experience of oneness or unity with objects and/or persons perceived in your surroundings.
- [ ] 8. Experience of the insight that “all is One.”
- [ ] 9. Awareness of the life or living presence in all things.
- [ ] 10. Gain of insightful knowledge experienced at an intuitive level.
- [ ] 11. Certainty of encounter with ultimate reality (able to “know” and “see” what is really real at some point during your experience).
- [ ] 12. You are convinced now, as you look back on your experience, that in it you encountered ultimate reality (i.e., that you “knew” and “saw” what was really real).

- [ ] 23. Loss of your usual sense of space.
- [ ] 24. Loss of usual awareness of where you were.
- [ ] 25. Sense of being “outside of” time, beyond past and future.
- [ ] 26. Being in a realm with no space boundaries.
- [ ] 27. Experience of timelessness.
- [ ] 28. Sense that the experience cannot be described adequately in words.
- [ ] 29. Feeling that you could not do justice to your experience by describing it in words.
- [ ] 30. Feeling that it would be difficult to communicate your own experience to others who have not had similar experiences.

**Scoring / quick mapping notes**
- MEQ-30 has 4 factors: *Mystical (unity/noetic/sacredness), Positive mood, Transcendence of time & space, Ineffability.* Use those factor headers as MLFM/SES groupings (e.g., `#MEQ/Mystical`, `#MEQ/Ineffability`).
- A “complete mystical experience” is commonly scored as meeting ≥60% of maximum on *each* of the four MEQ subscales (Barrett et al., 2015). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

# CEQ (Challenging Experience Questionnaire) — structure & usage notes

**Core:** 26 items, 7 factors (developed from HRS, 5D-ASC, and SOCQ; validated as stand-alone CEQ). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## CEQ factors (use as MLFM negative/perturbation layer tags)

- **Fear** — e.g., frightened, panic, anxious, “I had the feeling something horrible would happen.”  
- **Grief** — e.g., sad, feelings of grief, despair, feel like crying.  
- **Physical Distress** — somatic discomfort (nausea, physical pain, heart palpitations, etc.).  
- **Insanity** — feelings of “going insane” or loss of sanity / loss of mental control.  
- **Isolation** — feelings of deep isolation, alienation (subjective social disconnection).  
- **Death** — subjective experiences of death/dying (impending death, death imagery).  
- **Paranoia** — (two items) e.g., “feeling that people were plotting against you,” “experience of antagonism toward people around you.”  

> Note: Appendix 1 (supplement) of Barrett et al., 2016 provides the **stand-alone CEQ exact 26 items** in the canonical SOCQ prose/format. Use that text for exact item-level mapping and importing into your checklists. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

**Scoring notes**
- Items rated with SOCQ-style scale (0–5 in the CEQ papers).  
- CEQ factors are robust across samples; factor scores correlate with difficulty, meaningfulness, and enduring well-being measures (see Barrett et al., 2016). :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## DMT — entity-encounter papers (practical extracts for RFN/MLFM mapping)

## Davis et al., 2020 — *Survey of entity-encounter experiences (Johns Hopkins)* (n = 2,561; online survey)

**What they coded / how (high-level)**  
- Collected single most-memorable inhaled DMT entity encounter per respondent.  
- Key domains coded (examples): primary senses involved (visual, extrasensory/telepathic), entity labels/phenotypes (being, guide, spirit, alien, helper), entity attributes (conscious, intelligent, benevolent), emotions (fear, love, kindness, joy), whether messages or predictions were received, changes in religious identity/worldview, enduring effects on meaning/purpose. NVivo-style thematic coding for open text (see data availability statement). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

**Useful numeric findings you can map immediately**
- n = **2,561** respondents (mean age ≈ 32; 77% male). :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Primary senses: **visual** and **extrasensory (telepathic)** prominent. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Common entity labels: **being, guide, spirit, alien, helper**. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- **69%** of respondents reported receiving a message; **19%** reported a prediction about the future. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Many respondents interpreted entities as conscious/intelligent and existing in a different dimension; significant proportion experienced enduring worldview change (e.g., loss of prior atheism). :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

**Where the raw qualitative coding lives**
- Davis et al. note NVivo source data and coded tables in the supplement / data-availability statement and invite requests to the chief investigator. If you want NVivo-coded units (node lists, frequency counts, exemplar quotes per node), request the supplemental NVivo tables or contact the corresponding author (D.W.L. / A.K.D. depending on study). :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

## Lawrence et al., 2022 — *Naturalistic Reddit corpus analysis (r/DMT; n ≈ 3,778 experiences)* (Scientific Reports)

**Coding approach**
- Large corpus scraping (Pushshift) → manual screening → qualitative thematic coding (NVivo-style) across seven major thematic domains:
  1. physical and somatic experiences  
  2. visualizations and imagery  
  3. entity encounters (phenotype, attributes, disposition)  
  4. typology/architecture/scenery of the “DMT world”  
  5. alterations in consciousness (mystical, OOB, ego-dissolution)  
  6. emotional responses (positive/rewarding and challenging)  
  7. statements of profundity. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

**Representative frequencies (helpful for weighting RFN categories)**
- Visual patterns: **fractals, shapes, patterns** — **32.6%** of experiences. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- Vivid colours: **25.2%**. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- **Entity interactions** described as **positive** in many cases: ~**34.9%** categorized as benevolent/comforting; **companion/guide/pedagogical** interactions ≈ **32.4%**. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
- Architectural features noted: alternate/higher dimensions (~25.2%), “rooms” (~15.4%) including the “waiting room” (≈2.8%), and tunnels (≈10.3%). :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}

## Quick mapping guide (how to fold these into RFN / MLFM)

- Use **MEQ-30** factor tags for *mystical-layer* events (noetic, ineffability, time/space transcendence). Example tags: `#MEQ/Mystical`, `#MEQ/Ineffability`.  
- Use **CEQ** factor tags for *perturbation/negative* layers (fear, grief, insanity, death, physical, isolation, paranoia). Example tags: `#CEQ/Fear`, `#CEQ/Insanity`.  
- Use **DMT entity** nodes for *interactive field* and *agent* layers: phenotype (`#entity/guide`, `#entity/machine-like`), interaction type (`#entity/pedagogical`, `#entity/companion`), modalities (`#entity/telepathic`, `#entity/visual`), and architecture (`#env/tunnel`, `#env/waiting-room`).  
- For RFN/MLFM numeric modeling, weight features by reported frequency (e.g., if fractal visuals ≈32% in naturalistic corpora, treat `visual::fractals` as a mid-weight baseline feature). Use the Scientific Reports and Davis frequency tables as priors. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}
