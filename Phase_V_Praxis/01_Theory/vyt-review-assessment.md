# VYT - An In-Depth Review and Assessment

## Preface / Editorial Note

This document consolidates multiple layers of material about VYTYLS: artist-authored biography, archival AI-sourced commentary, an external web-search deep-dive, and the current technical inventory. Sections that originate from external sources are explicitly labeled as **archival / unverified**. The artist-verified facts (release metadata, gear list, and notes) are authoritative unless otherwise annotated.

## 1: Original Bio (Artist-authored - lightly copyedited)

"with an austere beat and a penchant for memory, Chicago-based electronic duo VYTYLS run a veritable shop of musical curiosities. pick up a track. turn it over in your hands and admire its craftsmanship and meticulous design. though the original intent and history of the piece may no longer be overtly discernible, the intricate, driving rhythms and atonal underwater soundscapes suggest an implicit purpose. one offering might attempt to communicate via dial-ups or esoteric and deep-sea-grit sampling; another, with an evolving click beat drowning in reflective synth melodies. some pieces may arouse a feeling of dismay while others may induce the hypnagogia of a dying battery. if you find yourself lacking this shared vocabulary, remaining content to listen to and observe the digital beauty of the music’s unyielding robotic language is still more than a simple pleasure. vytyls creations are never of the here, the now, or the mundane."

**Editorial note:** Minimal punctuation and capitalization edits were applied to preserve tone while improving readability. The full poetic register was intentionally retained.

## 2: Artist-Verified Release Metadata (Authoritative)

**Title:** rigit.veldt  
**Release date:** September 13, 2016  
**Format / Availability:** Bandcamp release; limited-run handcrafted USB keys (one-of-a-kind keys with unique sleeves, etched serial numbers, and embedded artwork/video content)  
**Track listing & run times:**  
- t1. *dollhouse* — 03:04

**About the track titles:** Naming was happenstantial; titles predated final sequencing and were selected for sonic cohesion. Any thematic relation (e.g., youth-associated resonance) was realized post hoc rather than intentionally encoded.

## 3. VYTYLS — Factual Third-Person Artist Profile

_(Rewritten from archival AI-sourced commentary and external web-search deep-dive; fully grounded, no hype inflation)_

**VYTYLS** is an experimental electronic music duo based in Chicago, composed of **Syence** and **Lative**. The project centers on live generative performance, non-standard tuning systems, real-time sample deformation, and algorithmic rhythm structures. Rather than working from fixed compositions, VYTYLS constructs bounded performance systems in which sound emerges through interaction between performers, software and hardware instruments, and probabilistic processes.

Their only official release to date, **_rigit.veldt_** (2016), was issued digitally via Bandcamp and as a limited series of handcrafted USB keys, each individually sleeved, etched, and loaded with exclusive audiovisual material. The release was assembled through sonic cohesion rather than conceptual pre-planning; track titles were retained from their original working names and only later noted to share incidental thematic resonance.

In live performance, Lative operates custom-built Reaktor ensembles comprising generative drum systems, a multi-oscillator drone synthesizer, and a monosynth tuned to modal and atonal pitch structures. Syence performs through a custom Max/MSP sample-mangling environment focused on real-time looping, granular deformation, and envelope-driven transformation, often re-embodied through analog guitar pedals. All sound sources are aligned to a shared tritonic tuning field, allowing rhythmic and harmonic material to behave as a unified system.

VYTYLS performances are characterized by emergent structure, deep inter-performer synchronization, and the continuous transformation of sound in real time. The project operates at the intersection of electronic performance, generative systems, and memory-based sound manipulation.

- Various MIDI keyboards & controllers

**Interfaces, Mixers & Recorders**  
- TASCAM Model 12 (digital mixer / multitrack recorder / USB audio interface)  
- PreSonus AudioBox 1818VSL  
- PreSonus AudioBox iTwo  
- Tascam DR-44WL (field recorder)  
- XENYX X2222USB mixer

- Whirlwind Quikpatch patch bay

**Outboard Signal Processing**  
- ULTRAGAIN PRO MIC2200 (tube preamp / DI / EQ)  
- COMPOSER PRO-XL MDX2600 (stereo compressor)  
- Behringer ULTRAGRAPH PRO (FBQ1502 / FBQ3102 / FBQ6200 variants)

**Synthesizers & Sound Modules (current list)**  
- Roland JD-Xi  
- KORG MS2000  
- Novation UltraNova  
*(Note: this list is not exhaustive; legacy hardware and retired synths are intentionally omitted.)*

**Effects Pedals (dedicated stompboxes used live / in studio)**  
- Behringer Heavy Distortion HD300  
- EarthQuaker Devices Afterneath  
- Electro-Harmonix Cathedral Stereo Reverb  
- Electro-Harmonix Platform (compressor/overdrive)  
- Electro-Harmonix Stereo Pulsar (tremolo/panner)  
- TC Electronic Flashback X4 Delay & Looper  
- Electro-Harmonix 720 Stereo Looper

**DAWs & Environments**  
- Logic Pro (studio composition & arrangement)  
- Native Instruments REAKTOR 6 (Lative: custom ensembles — 12-osc drone, monosynth, two drum engines including Game-of-Life driven synth)  
- Cycling '74 Max/MSP 9 (Syence: 4-module sample mangler patch)

**System Design Notes (practice-oriented):**  
- Shared tritonic tuning field across drone, percussive, and sampled material.  
- Reaktor ensembles and Max/MSP patches form the core of live generative behavior; analog pedals and mixers provide physical re-embodiment and coloration.  
- Behringer BCR2000 functions as a real-time structural mutator (pattern seeding, mute, envelope routing).
