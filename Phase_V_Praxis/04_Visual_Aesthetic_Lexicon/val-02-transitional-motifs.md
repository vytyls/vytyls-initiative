_Ports and folds where states overlap and transition._

| Term                  | Metaphysical Definition                                    | Technical Recipe (Datamosher JS snippet)                      | Reference      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Resonant Bridge       | Link motif connecting two aesthetic states.                | Cross-dissolve two clips over 2 s; tie opacity to audio peaks.|                |
| Recursive Corridor    | Tunnel-like path through layered domains.                  | Loop zoom on repeated frame; mask edges for seamless tile.    |                |
| Hypnogogic Portal     | Threshold frame where abstraction crystallizes.            | Apply kaleido effect; decrease sides from 8→2 over 1 s.       |                |
| Modal Layer Phasing   | Overlapping strata shifting in hue.                        | Stack 3 color-shifted layers; animate hue offset per layer.   |                |
| Pulsed Parallax       | Layered design optimized for parallax movement.            | Separate into foreground/midground/background; animate X/Y with inverse speeds. |                |
| Temporal Spill        | Overlapping time frames extending beyond focus.            | Overlay N-frame delayed copies at 40% alpha; feather mask edges. |                |
| Portal Frame          | Window motif hinting at another dimension.                 | Crop central region; scale to 120%; fade border from opacity 0→100%. |                |
