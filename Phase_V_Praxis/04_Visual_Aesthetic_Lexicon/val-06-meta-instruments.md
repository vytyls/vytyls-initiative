_Notations, logs, and glyphic software mapping reality._

| Term                      | Metaphysical Definition                                     | Technical Recipe (Datamosher JS snippet)                    | Reference      |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Reality Fold Notation     | Symbolic language encoding reality shifts.                  | Render vector shapes; animate overlap with ease-in/out.     |                |
| RFN Spiral Hint           | Concentric line suggesting fold notation.                   | Draw spiral with parametric equation; animate rotation.     |                |
| Modal Layer Field Map     | Map of stacked perceptual domains.                         | Composite N video layers with blend-mode overlays.          |                |
| Field Analysis Log        | Structured session metadata and annotations.               | Export JSON log of frame parameters; overlay text.          |                |
| Digital Reliquary Sigil   | Recursive glyph containing symbolic charge.                 | Recursive draw(); scale at each recursion; color shift.     |                |
| Glyphic Mirage            | Faint sigils woven into backgrounds.                       | Place glyph layer at 10% opacity; animate blur.             |                |
| Visual Trance Trigger     | Element inducing light trance through focus.                | Loop high-contrast pattern; keyframe flicker at 8 Hz.       |                |
| Perceptual Resonance Study| Analysis of glitch–audio coupling for entrainment.         | Sync visual modulations to audio FFT peaks.                 |                |
