_Identity dissolving, reforming, and self-observation._

| Term                   | Metaphysical Definition                                     | Technical Recipe (Datamosher JS snippet)                     | Reference      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Facefold Echo          | Image fold where identity becomes landscape.                | Duplicate layer; offset Y by 25px; blend with motion blur.   |                |
| Dreamwave Drift        | Fading presence in dream-like haze.                         | Apply per-row scan-offset; reduce opacity to 50%; loop drift.|                |
| Identity Bloom Field   | Expansion of self across signalspace.                       | Particle emit from center; expand radius with noise map.     |                |
| Involuted Gaze Array   | Mirrored eye sets observing from multiple planes.           | Mirror eyes in X and Y; stagger reveals over 8 frames.       |                |
| Unstable Witness Matrix| Looping forms acting as shifting observers.                 | Tile three copies; shift each copy’s hue by ±10°.            |                |
| Perceptual Core Extrusion | Inner symbolic forms erupting from center.              | Scale core mask from 0→150%; fade border; add glow.          |                |
| Etheric Splinter Field | Mist-like shards scattering in void.                        | Generate random shards; apply slow vertical drift; fade out. |                |
