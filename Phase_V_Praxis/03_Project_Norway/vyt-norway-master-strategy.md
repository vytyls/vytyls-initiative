# VYT - NOR - Master Strategy: Project Norway

**Status:** Active Phase I (Pilot)
**Objective:** To map the "Ancestral Geodesic" of the Larson lineage, utilizing the landscape of Norway and Wisconsin as a resonant cavity to test the **Field of Consciousness (FoC)** framework.
**Key Milestones:** Passports (Immediate), Westby/La Crosse Pilot Study (Immediate), Residency Applications (2026), Relocation (2026).

## 1. The Core Thesis: Ancestral Geodesics

**The "Great Inversion" Applied to Lineage:**
We posit that "Lineage" is not merely a historical narrative but a **Geodesic**—a path of least resistance through the geometry of spacetime, governed by the **Ontological Intention Tensor** ($T^{\mu\nu}_{\text{intent}}$).

**The "Runner's Loop":**
The artistic thesis is to physically occupy the coordinates of this geodesic. By placing the active Observer (VYTYLS) at both the **Origin** (Sannidal) and the **Terminus** (Westby/La Crosse), we close the loop, allowing for the measurement of the "Phase Transition" of the lineage signal.

## 2. The Genealogy Data (The Geodesic Map)

**A. The Origin (Sannidal, Norway)**
* **The Peak (1704–1793):** **Haukholt Farm**. (Jens Elevsen inherits it debt-free).
    * *Significance:* The state of high potential energy.
* **The Collapse (1832–1836):** **Tyvand Farm (Oppistua/Upper)**. (Kornelius Jenssen faces liquidation; farm sold).
    * *Significance:* The "Geodesic Tension" that forced the migration. The economic entropy of 1832 was the launch mechanism.
* **The Departure Point:** **Kragerø, Norway**.
    * *Event:* May 16, 1850. Lars Corneliusen (Passenger #57) boards the brig *Alert*.
    * *Metaphor:* The ship sailed "in ballast"—the ancestors were the weight that kept the vessel upright.

**B. The Terminus (Wisconsin, USA)**
* **The Inception (1850–1851):** **Stoughton, WI**.
    * *Event:* Cornelius Larson born here (1851).
    * *Current Location:* VYTYLS is currently stationed at the birthplace of the American line (Kegonsa Schoolhouse).
* **The Settlement (1870s):** **Westby (Coon Prairie), Vernon County**.
    * *Target:* Coon Prairie Cemetery (Lars Corneliusen's grave).
* **The Urbanization (1893–1944):** **La Crosse, WI**.
    * *Phase Transition:* The signal moves from rural farming to urban living.
    * *Targets:* 1111 Denton St (Cornelius) & 1909 State Rd (Peter Albert).

## 3. The Theoretical Integration (FoC / RFN / MLT)

This project is the practical application of the theoretical frameworks defined in **FoC Phase I & II**.

### **A. The Tyvand-Westby Axis**
In the language of **Reality Fold Notation (RFN)**, the migration from Tyvand (Norway) to Westby (Wisconsin) represents a **Layer Phase Shift**.
* **Crosspoint Marker (CM):** The specific farms (Tyvand/Haukholt) and graves (Coon Prairie) are "Crosspoint Markers" where the **Somatic Layer (L1)** (physical soil) intersects with the **Symbolic Layer (L3)** (lineage).
* **Dynamics:** We treat these sites as resonant cavities. By recording the **Impulse Response (IR)** of the Origin (Tyvand) and convolving it with the IR of the Terminus (Westby), we audibly "collapse" the distance between them.

## 4. The "Westby Impulse" Pilot Study (Grant Addendum)

*To be attached to BEK/NOTAM applications.*

**Project Title:** THEHRZHYOH
**Sub-Project:** The Westby Geodesic (Phase I - The Terminus)

**Methodological Actions:**
1.  **Acoustic Impulse Capture (L1):**
    * **Action:** Capture high-fidelity IRs at Coon Prairie Cemetery and the La Crosse addresses.
    * **Application:** These IRs function as the digital reverb containers for the "Mu" (Sub-bass) synthesis engine.
2.  **Linguistic Phase-Decay (L3/Lx):**
    * **Action:** Sample archival/field recordings of "Westby Norsk" (the frozen dialect).
    * **Technique:** Granular synthesis of phonemes to represent the decay of the "Old Country" signal.

## 5. Residency Strategy: The Two Prongs

**I. The Lab: BEK (Bergen Centre for Electronic Arts)**
* **Focus:** **Deep Research & "The Runner's Loop."**
* **Goal:** To process field recordings from Tyvand (Origin) and Westby (Terminus).
* **Argument:** "We need the isolation of the fjords to map the internal geometry of the FoC."

**II. The Stage: NOTAM (Oslo)**
* **Focus:** **Presentation & "The Handshake."**
* **Goal:** To perform the work in their Ambisonic sphere.
* **Argument:** "We need the technical precision of NOTAM to spatialize the geometry of the theoretical physics."

## 6. Strategic Logistics (The Schengen Protocol)

**The "90-Day Scout" Strategy:**
1.  **The "14-Day Rule":** Book shows at Østre (Bergen) or Jæger (Oslo) to trigger the "working artist" exception.
2.  **The "Letter of Intent":** Secure physical letters from venues for the residence permit application.
3.  **Timeline:** Oslo (Networking) $\to$ The Crossing (Field Research) $\to$ Bergen (Deep Work).

## 7. Financial & Business Viability

**Entity:** Sole Proprietorship (*Enkeltpersonforetak*)
**Funding Strategy (Phase I - The Angel):**
* **Source:** Private Family Investment (The "Executive Producer" Model).
* **Pitch:** Presenting the genealogy not as history, but as an active legacy project requiring "seed capital" for the Pilot Study.
* **Deliverable:** A comprehensive multimedia archive of the family lineage (Sound, Video, Location Data) returned to the family trust.

**"We are, so we will be."**
