# VYTYLS: Fjord Systems — Acoustic Ecology, Generative Performance, and Memory-Based Sound in Norway

**Principal Investigators:** Lative & Syence (VYTYLS)

**Submission Date:** Pending

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **2.0 Abstract / Project Summary**

This proposal seeks support for a groundbreaking artistic research project that merges environmental sound, generative music, and ancestral heritage. The project, led by the experimental electronic duo VYTYLS, will undertake an intensive, site-specific investigation of Norway’s unique acoustic ecology, treating the landscape not as a passive subject but as an active partner in a live cybernetic performance system. The research aims to pioneer a new methodology for environmentally driven composition, culminating in a series of innovative artistic works to be shared with the Norwegian and international arts communities.

VYTYLS (Lative & Syence) is an experimental electronic duo distinguished by their use of custom-built generative systems and a practice of mutual predictive improvisation. This project will involve an immersive acoustic ecology study in Norway, capturing a rich library of field recordings from fjords, maritime transit systems, weather patterns, and the national linguistic landscape. The core methodology involves integrating these captured sounds directly into the duo's bespoke Reaktor and Max/MSP performance instruments. This process of "generative translation" transforms environmental sound from mere texture into the primary driver of the system's rhythmic, harmonic, and structural behavior. The project's significance lies in this novel approach to composition, which treats the Norwegian environment as a "generative partner" and a "living sonic organism." This investigation is further grounded by a personal "acoustic heritage investigation," as performer Syence traces her Norse lineage (Larson) to its origins, exploring how ancestral memory resonates within a specific geographic and sonic space. The expected artistic outputs include a public live performance, a high-quality multichannel sound composition, and a documented research archive of the field recordings and transformed sonic material.

This proposal will now detail the foundational concepts, innovative context, and precise methodology that define this unique artistic and research endeavor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **3.0 Introduction & Statement of Need**

This section establishes the innovative context of VYTYLS's artistic practice and argues for the necessity of this specific research in Norway. By contrasting their cybernetic performance model with traditional methods, it will articulate a unique statement of need: to explore how a place’s intrinsic sonic and ancestral geometry can become an active, co-creative force in a musical system.

Where traditional electronic music performance often centers on the playback of fixed compositions, VYTYLS's practice is one of radical emergence. Their work involves creating "living sound systems"—bounded, condition-rich fields where music arises from the complex interactions between human intention, machine autonomy, and environmental input. This moves beyond authorship to a form of systemic cultivation, where the artists design and modulate a sonic ecosystem rather than dictate its every event.

The project is grounded in a central thesis termed the **"Great Inversion"**: the proposition that consciousness is the architect of reality, not its byproduct. This project is an experiment in applied architecture, investigating how the artists' operational intention can interact with the "ontological geometry" of a specific place. By using Norway’s acoustic ecology not as sound but as behavioral input and structural drivers, the research aims to engage the environment as a co-architect. The methodology is a direct test of this thesis, pioneering a new, cybernetic model of site-specific performance uniquely enabled by Norway’s landscape. The project's personal connection to the region is not merely thematic; Syence’s Norse lineage provides a rigorous, pre-defined transect for data collection, transforming personal heritage into a methodological strength that makes the project’s location non-arbitrary and essential.

The need for this research arises from a distinct gap between environmental art, generative music, and heritage studies. By treating Norway’s acoustic ecology as a _behavioral input_ and _active system driver_, the project moves beyond documentation to genuine collaboration. This research is necessary to explore how the unique sonic identity of a place can be translated not just into sound, but into the very logic and behavior of a musical organism.

The following section will situate this unique approach within the broader theoretical and artistic context in which it operates, highlighting its specific innovations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **4.0 Context and Innovation**

This section serves as a conceptual literature review, positioning the project at the intersection of established artistic and scientific fields. While drawing from acoustic ecology, generative music, and cybernetic performance, the project's primary innovation is the introduction of the **Field of Consciousness (FoC)**, a novel theoretical framework that unifies these practices. The Field of Consciousness (FoC) is the project's unifying theoretical model, which posits that the underlying structure of reality is a geometric field that can be influenced by intention and mapped through acoustic resonance.

#### **Relationship to Established Fields**

- **Acoustic Ecology & Field Recording:** The project extends the tradition of acoustic ecology beyond passive documentation or atmospheric soundscaping. Environmental sound is not treated as ambience but as primary data and a behavioral catalyst. Recordings of fjords, harbors, and rainfall will be analyzed for their dynamic and textural properties and used directly as **rhythmic triggers, spectral modulators, and harmonic destabilizers**, transforming the environment into an active agent within the performance system.
- **Generative & Algorithmic Music:** VYTYLS’s methodology creates a state of **"bounded entropy"**—a system that is neither fully deterministic nor fully chaotic. The use of algorithmic drivers like Conway's _Game of Life_ cellular automaton in their Reaktor ensembles, combined with the constraint of a shared tritonic tuning field across all instruments, ensures that while the system's output is unpredictable moment-to-moment, it remains within a coherent and musically legible ecosystem. This allows for genuine emergence without dissolving into unstructured noise.
- **Cybernetic Performance:** The performance practice is defined by a phenomenon of **"mutual predictive synchronization"** between the two human performers. Through deep familiarity with their interconnected systems, Lative and Syence anticipate and respond to each other's actions without explicit cues, creating a feedback loop that includes their instruments. This transforms the duo into a **"dual-human, multi-machine, cybernetic improvisational organism,"** where intention and response flow seamlessly between human and non-human agents.

#### **Core Innovation: The Field of Consciousness (FoC) Framework**

The project’s unique contribution is the **Field of Consciousness (FoC)** framework, which serves as the theoretical and operational core unifying these practices. Within this framework, the project's central navigational principle is the **"Ancestral Geodesic"**—a theoretical path of least resistance through the geometry of spacetime, defined by a specific lineage. For this project, the geodesic is that of performer Syence's Larson family, which originates in Norway. This concept reframes the artistic investigation from a simple exploration of place to a targeted acoustic mapping of a "pre-stressed geometric channel" within the FoC lattice. By following this channel, the artists hypothesize they can access and map the sonic and resonant properties of the landscape with greater depth and coherence, framing personal lineage as a scientific tool rather than a thematic overlay.

This theoretical context provides the foundation for the project's specific goals, objectives, and practical execution, which are detailed in the following section.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **5.0 Project Narrative: Goals, Objectives, and Methodology**

This section details the core of the proposed research, outlining the project's high-level goals, the specific and measurable objectives required to achieve them, and the precise technical and artistic methodology that will be employed throughout the residency.

#### **5.1 Goals & Objectives**

The project is driven by two primary, interconnected goals:

- To conduct a pioneering case study in using a specific lineage path—the Norwegian segment of the Larson family’s Ancestral Geodesic—as a methodology for a deep, site-specific acoustic investigation of Norwegian sonic heritage and landscape.
- To create and disseminate a new body of artistic work—including a live performance and a multichannel sound composition—derived entirely from the generative translation of Norway's unique acoustic ecology.

To achieve these goals, the following specific and measurable objectives have been defined:

1. Conduct a systematic field recording survey across key Norwegian sites, capturing the acoustic signatures of fjords, maritime infrastructure, weather patterns, and linguistic environments.
2. Integrate all recorded material into VYTYLS's custom-built generative performance systems, translating environmental sound into musical data.
3. Develop a series of "field-specific performance states" where environmental sound directly drives the system's rhythmic, harmonic, and textural behavior.
4. Culminate the residency with a public performance at a partner institution like NOTAM, showcasing the Norway-derived generative work.
5. Produce a high-quality audio documentation of the work and a publicly accessible sound archive for future artistic and academic research.

#### **5.2 Methodology**

The research will be conducted in three distinct yet overlapping phases, each building upon the last to create a living, environmentally-driven performance ecosystem.

##### **Phase A: Acoustic Ecology Field Recording**

This initial phase focuses on intensive data collection. The target sound sources include the dynamic acoustic environments of fjords, the industrial resonance of harbor machinery, the probabilistic texture of rainfall, the complex reflections of urban verticality, and the percussive qualities of Norwegian phonemes. The recording methodology will prioritize capturing wide dynamic range and microtextural variation, treating these sounds as primary data for generative systems rather than as aesthetic background material.

##### **Phase B: Generative System Integration**

This phase involves the core process of "generative translation." All recorded audio material will be cataloged and integrated into the VYTYLS performance system. Key steps include:

- **Harmonic Unification:** All samples will be digitally retuned into a shared **tritonic harmonic field**, ensuring that disparate sound sources can coexist within a coherent musical framework.
- **System Mapping:** The prepared material will be mapped into Lative's **Reaktor ensembles**, where it will influence the behavior of generative engines driven by Conway's _Game of Life_, and into Syence's **custom Max/MSP sample mangling modules**, where it will be subjected to real-time granular deformation and loop destabilization.
- **Behavioral Input:** This process transforms the environmental sound from a static asset into a dynamic, **behavioral input** that actively shapes the emergent output of the performance organism.

##### **Phase C: Live Performance Research**

The final phase focuses on developing the performance itself. The research will not result in a fixed composition but in a **living performance ecosystem**. The artists will experiment with mapping specific environmental phenomena to musical parameters. For example:

- Sustained rainfall will be used as a noise-floor carrier and probabilistic rhythm source, with its recorded density controlling rhythmic probability.
- The cyclical frequencies of a ferry engine could drive a series of subharmonic drones.
- The percussive qualities of Norwegian phonemes will be mapped to the generative drum engines.
- Impulse Responses (IRs) captured at ancestral sites—a technique piloted in the "Westby Impulse" study—will be used to create resonant sonic containers, imbuing the digital sounds with the acoustic signature of a physical, historically significant space.

This three-phase methodology provides a clear and robust pathway to achieving the project's ambitious goals, leading into the practical timeline for its execution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **6.0 Timeline & Milestones**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **7.0 Personnel & Team Expertise**

The project will be executed by the experimental electronic duo VYTYLS. Their distinct but deeply integrated skill sets form a unique symbiotic system, perfectly suited for the technical and conceptual demands of this research. Their collaborative process is built on years of developing a shared language between their respective human-machine interfaces.

#### Lative

Lative's role within the duo is the management of **generative rhythm and harmonic field control**. His primary instrument is a custom-built environment in **Native Instruments Reaktor**, which includes a 12-oscillator drone synthesizer and a complex drum engine driven by the cellular automaton Conway’s _Game of Life_. In performance, he functions as a **"stochastic state mutator"** and **"real-time structural rewriter,"** seeding, shaping, and modulating the probabilistic systems that form the architectural foundation of the music.

#### Syence

Syence is responsible for **sample deformation and temporal memory systems**. Her technical expertise is centered on a **custom multi-module Max/MSP system for real-time granular deformation and loop destabilization**. She often routes these digitally transformed sounds through a chain of analog pedals to "re-embody" them with physical texture and resonance. Crucially, it is Syence’s **Norse lineage (Larson)** and her conceptual role as the project's **"Witness"** that provides the essential personal grounding for the **"Ancestral Geodesic"** investigation, linking the project's advanced technical methods to a deep, personal inquiry into heritage and place.

Their collaborative process can be described as a form of **"distributed pre-conscious musical cognition."** Through their interconnected systems and deep familiarity, they achieve a state of emergent coherence, allowing complex musical structures to arise in real time without pre-composition or explicit signaling.
