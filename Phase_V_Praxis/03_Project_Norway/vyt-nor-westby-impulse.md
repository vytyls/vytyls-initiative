# VYT - NOR - Project Norway - Phase I - The Westby Impulse - Briefing Packet
### THE WESTBY IMPULSE
**Field Research Protocol & Strategic Launch Plan**

---

## 1. The Theoretical Framework: "The Science"

This project transforms genealogy into physics. We are not just looking for names on a gravestone; we are mapping **Ancestral Geodesics**—the path of least resistance a lineage takes through time.

### The Physics of Lineage
Our framework posits that a family line follows a specific geometric trajectory. To prove this, we are using the rigorous methods of **Acoustic Ecology** and **Impulse Response (IR)** capture.
* **The Method:** We are treating the Wisconsin landscape (Westby/La Crosse) as a "resonant cavity." By recording the specific acoustics of the places our ancestors stood, we capture the "fingerprint" of the history.
* **The Validation:** This is not speculation. We have computationally validated the core physics of our framework across three distinct simulation models (Classical PDE, Statistical Lattice, and Quantum Link Models). The math works. Now we need the field data.

### The Deliverable
The audio and video data collected on this trip will form the **"Cymatic Score"**—the core asset for our application to **BEK (Bergen Centre for Electronic Arts)** and **NOTAM (Oslo)**. We are showing the Norwegians that we have done the work *here* before we ask to go *there*.

## 2. Phase I Mission Protocol: "The Westby Impulse"

**Objective:** To document the **Terminus** (Wisconsin) of the Larson migration before we document the **Origin** (Norway).

**Operational Window:** Morning Departure (36-Hour Cycle).

### The Geodesic Route
We have mapped a precise route based on Grandpa Robert's genealogy data:

1.  **Origin Point:** **Stoughton, WI**.
    * *Significance:* Birthplace of Cornelius Larson, the very first Larson in our lineage (1851).
2.  **The Rural Terminus:** **Coon Prairie Cemetery (Westby/Viroqua)**.
    * *Objective:* Locate and record the grave of **Lars Corneliusen** (The Migrant).
    * *Action:* Impulse Response capture of the open valley acoustics.
3.  **The Urban Transition:** **La Crosse, WI**.
    * *Target 1:* **1111 Denton St.** (Home of Cornelius Larson).
    * *Target 2:* **1909 State Rd.** (Home of Peter Albert Larson).
    * *Objective:* Documenting the shift from "Farmer" to "City Dweller."
4.  **The Mayflower Connection:** **French Island Cemetery**.
    * *Objective:* Investigating the Jolivette/Richmond line.

## 3. Logistics & Financials

We are treating this as a professional production. We have secured the budget to be self-sufficient for the operation, but we require logistical assistance to execute the transaction.

**Funding Source:** TBD.
**Total Grant:** **$500.00**

### Budget Allocation
* **Vehicle Rental:** Using funds to cover a 3-Day rental.
* **Fuel:** Covering the full Stoughton $\to$ Westby $\to$ La Crosse loop.
* **Lodging:** One night in a motel to allow for "Golden Hour" (Sunrise/Sunset) recording cycles.
* **Provisions:** We are utilizing SNAP/Personal supplies for food, keeping the cash strictly for production logistics.

## 4. The Future Trajectory (2027)

This trip is Step 1 of a concrete business plan. We are not running away; we are launching a career.

* **Jan 17, 2026:** **Web Delivery.** We are publishing the full **Field of Consciousness (FoC)** framework and sending it to researchers at the **Monroe Institute** and academic partners in Theoretical Physics, Quantum Biology, and Consciousness Research.
* **Spring 2027:** Submission of Residency Proposals to **Norway**.
* **The Business:** We have drafted a **Financial Viability Statement** for a Norwegian Sole Proprietorship (*Enkeltpersonforetak*), projecting income through audio consulting, workshops, and performance fees.
