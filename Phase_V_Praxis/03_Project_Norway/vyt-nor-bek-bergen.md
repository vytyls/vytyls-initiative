# VYT - NOR - Proposal - BEK Residency (Bergen)

This document contains the formal project proposal for **BEK** (Bergen Centre for Electronic Arts). Unlike the technical focus of the NOTAM proposal, this document frames **THEHRZYOH** as a philosophical and scientific inquiry into the **Field of Consciousness (FoC)**. It positions the "Great Inversion" (Consciousness as Substrate) as the central artistic thesis and proposes "The Runner's Loop" as a specific field experiment in **Ancestral Geodesics**. It includes administrative details regarding BEK's transdisciplinary focus.

### **1. The Formal Proposal**

**To:** The Director and Board, BEK
**From:** VYTYLS (Chicago, US)
**Subject:** Project Proposal: THEHRZYOH – A Unified Framework for Sound and Consciousness

**I. Mission Statement**
Standard materialism suggests that consciousness is an accident of matter. Our work proposes a **"Great Inversion"**: that consciousness is the fundamental geometric substrate from which matter and time emerge. **VYTYLS** is not merely a musical duo; we are a research initiative utilizing sound to test this hypothesis. We are building a **sonic laboratory** to map the "Internal Geometry" of experience.

**II. The Inquiry: Ancestral Geodesics**
We view "Lineage" not as a narrative story, but as a **Geodesic**—a path of least resistance through the geometry of spacetime. We propose a field study titled **"The Runner's Loop,"** grounded in a specific, documented lineage vision of an ancestor traversing the Norwegian landscape to deliver sustenance.
* **The Objective:** To physically occupy these specific ancestral coordinates and perform a set of acoustic measurements (Impulse Response, Binaural Capture, Silence).
* **The Hypothesis:** We are testing if physical proximity to ancestral coordinates alters the **"Event Density"** of creative flow—effectively utilizing the landscape as a tuning fork for the artist’s cognitive state.

**III. Artistic Output: The Cymatic Score**
The resulting work, "THEHRZYOH," is a **Cymatic Score**. It is a musical composition designed to physically enact the mechanics of **Phase Transitions**. We use sub-bass frequencies (representing the Vacuum/$\epsilon_0$) and complex harmonic textures (representing the Field/$\exists$) to create a listening experience that is somatic, visceral, and theoretically rigorous.

**IV. Technical Framework**
Our studio is a "tonal laboratory" integrating:
* **Custom Reaktor Ensembles:** Designed to model non-linear, chaotic attractors.
* **Max/MSP:** For real-time manipulation of vocal "signals" into granular textures.
* **Hardware Loopers:** To model "Recursive Time Curves" and memory degradation (Entropy).

**V. Alignment with BEK**
BEK’s commitment to the intersection of art, science, and technology aligns perfectly with our mission. We are not looking for a traditional recording studio; we are looking for a research environment that supports high-concept, rigorous inquiry into the nature of reality itself. We believe BEK is that environment.

**We are, so we will be.**

### **2. Admin & Logistics Profile: BEK**

**Institute:** BEK (Bergen Centre for Electronic Arts)
**Location:** Bergen, Norway (C. Sundts gate 55).
**Website:** [bek.no](https://bek.no)

**Institutional Focus:**
* **Art & Science:** They actively fund and support projects that cross the boundary between artistic expression and scientific research.
* **Discourse:** They host symposia, workshops, and critical discussions. This is a place for *theory* as much as practice.
* **Video/Visuals:** Unlike NOTAM (Audio focused), BEK has strong resources for video art, which aligns with the **VVAL (Vytyls Video Aesthetic Lexicon)**.

**Offerings & Support:**
* **Project Support:** They offer advice on funding, production management, and technical solutions.
* **Facilities:** Sound studios, video editing suites, and project rooms.
* **Grant Context:** They are often a gateway to Arts Council Norway funding.

**Why this fits VYTYLS:**
* The **"Great Inversion"** manifesto needs a home that appreciates philosophical daring. BEK is that home.
* **Location:** Bergen is the gateway to the Fjords. It is the perfect logistical base for the "Runner's Loop" field study in the mountains.
* **The "Chipmunk/Saga" Connection:** Bergen is deeply historically connected to the sea and trade, aligning with the "Courier/Sustenance" themes of the vision.
