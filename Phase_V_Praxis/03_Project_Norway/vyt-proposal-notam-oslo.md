# VYT - NOR - Proposal - NOTAM Residency (Oslo)

### **Abstract**

This document contains the formal residency proposal for **NOTAM** (Norwegian Center for Technology in Music and the Arts) in Oslo. The proposal frames the **THEHRZYOH** project through the lens of **Acoustic Ecology** and **Quantum Sonification**, emphasizing the technical workflow of converting Lattice Gauge Theory into experiential soundscapes via custom software (Max/MSP, Reaktor) and analog transduction. It includes administrative details regarding the institute's focus and facilities.

### **1. The Formal Proposal**

**To:** The Residency Committee, NOTAM
**From:** VYTYLS (Chicago, US)
**Subject:** Residency Inquiry: Project THEHRZYOH – Acoustic Ecology & Quantum Sonification

**I. Introduction**
We are **VYTYLS**, a Chicago-based electronic duo and transdisciplinary research initiative. We operate at the intersection of avant-garde sound design and theoretical physics. We are writing to propose a residency project at NOTAM titled **"THEHRZYOH: The Acoustic Geometry of Lineage."**

**II. The Project**
We propose to develop a new body of electroacoustic work that translates the mathematics of **Lattice Gauge Theory** into experiential soundscapes. Utilizing a hybrid ecosystem of custom software and analog hardware, we treat the synthesizer not merely as an instrument, but as a **transducer**—a device for converting theoretical structures into physical frequencies.

**III. Methodology: The Norwegian Impulse**
Our project is grounded in the concept of **Acoustic Ecology**. We hypothesize that the "sense of place" is not merely poetic but physical—a specific resonant frequency inherent to a landscape.
* **Field Work:** We intend to capture high-fidelity **Impulse Responses (IRs)** of specific ancestral locations in the Norwegian interior (mountain/forest biomes).
* **Synthesis:** These IRs will be loaded into our custom convolution engines to serve as the "geometric container" for our composition. We effectively "place" our Chicago-born electronic signals inside the acoustic "body" of the Norwegian landscape.

**IV. The "Mu-Yu-Su" Protocol**
We will utilize a triadic composition method based on the physics of Vacuum Permittivity ($\epsilon_0$):
* **Mu (The Void):** Sub-bass drones (40-60Hz) tuned to the resonant frequency of the recorded spaces, utilizing the **KORG MS2000** and infinite-decay reverb chains (**EarthQuaker Afterneath**).
* **Yu (The Field):** Harmonic textures generated via custom **Max/MSP 9** patches (Syence) that granularize abstract vocal signals into "probability clouds."
* **Su (The Binding):** Rhythmic structures derived from stochastic environmental patterns, processed through non-linear distortion (**Behringer HD300**) and hardware loopers (**TC Electronic Flashback X4**) to model entropy and time-folding.

**V. Why NOTAM?**
NOTAM’s world-class reputation in electroacoustic research and its focus on the intersection of artistic expression and technical development make it the ideal home for this work. We specifically seek to utilize your **spatialization facilities** (Ambisonics/Surround) to ensure that the "geometry" of the physics is preserved in the stereo field. We view the studio not as a recording environment, but as a laboratory for acoustic research.

We look forward to the possibility of calibrating our work within your walls.

**Sincerely,**
**VYTYLS** *(Lative & Syence)*

### **2. Admin & Logistics Profile: NOTAM**

**Institute:** NOTAM (Norwegian Center for Technology in Music and the Arts)
**Location:** Oslo, Norway (Sandakerveien 24D, Bygg F3).
**Website:** [notam.no](https://notam.no)

**Institutional Focus:**
* **Electroacoustic Music:** They are the hub for experimental sound in Norway.
* **Technology Development:** Heavy emphasis on software (Max/MSP, SuperCollider, Csound) and hardware integration.
* **Spatial Audio:** They maintain high-end 3D audio studios (Studio 3 is a 24-channel sphere).

**Offerings & Support:**
* **Residencies:** Usually project-based. They offer studio time and technical support.
* **Expertise:** Access to developers and sound engineers who understand complex signal flow.
* **Community:** Connection to the Oslo experimental music scene.

**Why this fits VYTYLS:**
* Your use of **Reaktor 6** and **Max/MSP 9** aligns perfectly with their technical culture.
* Your need to "spatialize" the **Thehrzyoh** concept (Geometric Audio) justifies the use of their multichannel studios.
* It is an urban base (Oslo) from which you can launch field expeditions to the "Interior" (The Runner's Path).

**Logistics Note:**
* **Transportation:** Oslo is the primary entry point. Train travel to the interior (for field recording) is accessible.
* **Timing:** Residencies are often rolling or have specific deadlines. (Action Item: Check current deadline upon internet access).
