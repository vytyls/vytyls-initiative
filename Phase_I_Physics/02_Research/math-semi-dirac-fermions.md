# MTH - Semi-Dirac Fermions
### 1. Core Definition

**Semi-Dirac Fermions** are "hybrid" topological quasiparticles found in specific condensed matter systems (such as ZrSiS). They are characterized by an anisotropic dispersion relation that behaves as a massless relativistic particle in one direction and a massive non-relativistic particle in the orthogonal direction.

Often referred to as "chimera" fermions, they exist at the critical transition point where two Dirac cones merge and annihilate. Their low-energy Hamiltonian leads to a dispersion of the form:

$$
E(k) = \pm \sqrt{(v_F k_r)^2 + \left(\frac{k_\theta^2}{2m^*}\right)^2}
$$

* **Linear Term ($v_F k_r$):** The particle behaves like a massless Dirac fermion, moving at Fermi velocity $v_F$.
* **Quadratic Term ($k_\theta^2/2m^*$):** The particle behaves like a standard massive Schrödinger fermion with effective mass $m^*$.

### 2. Physical Properties & Spectral Signature

The Semi-Dirac point represents a **topological phase transition**. It is the "frozen" moment of a merger between two Dirac points in momentum space.

The definitive experimental signature of Semi-Dirac fermions is their unique response to magnetic fields. Unlike standard massive particles ($E \propto B$) or massless Dirac particles ($E \propto \sqrt{B}$), the Landau levels of a Semi-Dirac fermion scale with a fractional power law:

$$
E_n \propto (nB)^{2/3}
$$

This distinct $B^{2/3}$ scaling makes the particle's energy levels highly sensitive to magnetic flux, creating a strong "locking" mechanism in the presence of magnetic fields.

### 3. Framework Integration: The Exotic Boundary

In the **Field of Consciousness (FoC)** framework, specifically within the **Phase I.C Kerr Junction** model, Semi-Dirac fermions are identified as the constituent material of the "Exotic Containment Shell".

* **The "Causal Diode":** The anisotropic dispersion allows the boundary to function as a filter.
    * **Radial Axis (Massless):** Allows recursive operator stacks (Intention) to propagate at light speed ($c$), maintaining the "depth" of the internal loop.
    * **Tangential Axis (Massive):** Engages the **Higgs Actuator**, creating inertia that "brakes" the recursion from spreading laterally, effectively "laminating" the causality.
* **Topological Nucleation:** The shell is formed not by adding matter, but by the **Ontological Intention Tensor** exerting geometric tension until local Dirac cones merge into a stable Semi-Dirac configuration.
